In The Meow Jungle, each player acts as a food hunter for the king of the Meow Jungle, named Peppercorn Cat. There are nine food spots on the gameboard (the jungle map). Each spot has three levels of depth. Different foods are generated at one of the levels of each spot, but the precise location of the food is hidden from the players. The objective of the game is to score the highest number of total food points. Points can be earned by finding food on the map and trying to get the best combination according to the menu. Players must perform one (and only one) of the three actions on their turn. The three actions are Detect, Gain Strength, and Dig.

To detect a food location, players tap the food detector on the Detect action card and then tap on one food spot icon to detect for food. The LED matrix display on the food detector (the device) will display how deep the food is buried (one, two, or three). Then a digital six-sided dice will automatically be rolled by displaying the process and the result on the LED matrix. Players have a one-sixth chance (rolling one will give player the clue) to identify which food is under the spot. If successful, the LED matrix on top of the food detector will display the name of the food. The chances of identifying the exact food under the spot are increased by one-sixth when players own a food under the same category. For instance, owning a “canned chicken” will increase the chance of knowing a chicken flavoured food to two-sixth (rolling one or two). The maximum chance to a category is three-sixth, or 50% (rolling one, two, or three).

Players need to gain strength to perform a Dig action. Players tap the food detector on the Gain Strength action card to earn one digging strength. Players can earn one digging strength each time and store up to 3 digging strengths. The food detector will constantly display digging strengths when there are no special events. To dig a spot, players tap the food detector on the Dig action card and then tap on one spot to dig the food spot. Players can dig out chicken flavour dry food, canned chicken, freeze-dried chicken, chicken puree treat, canned beef, beef flavour dry food, seafood flavour dry food, canned seafood and a cucumber. The depth of the food determines the amount of digging strength required. If the player does not have the exact number of digging strengths required, the player will waste their digging strength and fail to dig out the food. If players perform a successful Dig action, the LED matrix will display the corresponding name to the food. Dug food is added to the player’s inventory unless it is a cucumber. When a player digs out a cucumber, the player can immediately throw it to another player by tapping their food detector on the card that represents the other player. The player who receives the cucumber will lose two food points.

There is a set amount of each type of food. After a player successfully digs out a food item, the system will automatically put a randomly generated food item back to the same food spot but on a different level. A player can dig up to fifteen times. Once a player has used up all fifteen digging chances, the game ends after other players have one final turn. The system will automatically calculate the score according to the combinations and food points on the menu (the algorithms will always look for more valuable combinations) and display the score on each players’ food detector. The player with the most points wins the game. If there is a tie in the total food points, the game will compare strength used (fewer) and then Detect actions used (fewer) until a winner is selected. If a winner is still not selected, the players tied for the game all win.
